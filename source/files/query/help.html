		<h2>Search Instructions</h2>
		<h3>Selecting Servers to Search</h3>
		<p>
			Clicking "Select Libraries to Search" displays a dialog box allowing selection of one or more libraries to search. If no sites are selected, the first site in the list is searched by default. To select more than one site, hold the "Ctrl" key down while clicking on additional sites.
		</p>
		<h3>Search Fields</h3>
		<p>
			The query page contains buttons allowing selection of groups of related fields as well as modifiers which define how many results are to be displayed in one search and how the results are to be displayed.
		<p>
			The fields are used to search for documents containing information of specific types. Searches require documents to match all fields specified on the query page. If a field is blank, the search accepts all documents as matches for that field.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each field may be composed of multiple search words. A query field containing
			<font color="red"><code>abc def</code></font> matches only documents containing both <font color="red"><code>abc</code></font> and <font color="red"><code>def</code></font> (in any order) in that field.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Free Text query field searches for items anywhere in a document, while the other query fields search only information identified within the document as being of the identified type.
		</p>
		<h3>Display as unknowns</h3>
		<p>
			The "Display as unknowns" checkbox requests storage services to display both query results and documents using the "unknown" fields in the document.
		</p>
		<h3>Show images in results</h3>
		<p>
			The "Show images in results" checkbox requests storage services to include representative images from documents in the query results.
		</p>
		<h3>Case navigator</h3>
		<p>
			The "Case navigator" checkbox causes query results to be displayed in a form that provides immediate access to the documents..
		</p>
		<h3>Randomize results</h3>
		<p>
			The "Randomize results" checkbox causes the documents displayed in the Case navigator to be shuffled before display.
		</p>
		<h3>Suppress icon images</h3>
		<p>
			The "Suppress icon images" checkbox requests storage services to suppress the display of thumbnail images when documents are displayed in the MSTF format. These images are normally displayed in the lower left part of the window and are used for rapid access to the images in the document.
		</p>
		<h3>Results per Site</h3>
		<p>
			The "results/site" field determines the maximum number of responses requested from each library searched. The buttons on the search results page allow the user to request additional groups of results from the storage services.
		</p>
		<h3>Document format</h3>
		<p>
			The "Document format" field allows the user to select the format in which the document is to be displayed. Choosing "Document format" causes the author's specified format to be used. Other choices (Page, Tab, and MSTF) allow the user to override the author's choice.
		</p>
		<h3>Document background</h3>
		<p>
			The "Document background" field allows the user to select the background color in which the document is to be displayed. Choosing "Document backgrount" causes the author's specified background to be used. Other choices (Light and Dark) allow the user to override the author's choice.
		</p>
		<h3>Clear all query fields</h3>
		<p>
			The "Clear all query fields" button erases all the query fields in all the groups, whether they are visible at the time or not.
